## Installing Watchman and initialize project with Expo

### Expo CLI
Expo CLI is a command-line tool that is the primary interface between a developer and other Expo tools. It is used for different tasks in the development life cycle of your project, such as serving the project in development, viewing logs, opening the app on an emulator or a physical device, and so on.

To use Expo CLI, you need to have the following tools installed on your developer machine:
